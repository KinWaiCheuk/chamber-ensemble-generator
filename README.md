# Chamber Ensemble Geneartor and CocoChorales Dataset



Chamber Ensemble Generator is a music dataset generation pipeline consist of Coconet and MIDI-DDSP. Chamber Ensemble Generator can generates 4-part Bach Chorales performance audio with aligned notes, note expressions, synthesis parameters (f0, amplitudes, etc) and stems while enabling rich variations in generative process.

We use Chamber Ensemble Generator to generate a large-scale dataset CocoChorlaes. CocoChorales consists of 240,000 pieces in a total duration of 1400 hours, with aligned notes, note expressions, synthesis parameters (f0, amplitudes, etc) and stems. For details of CocoChorales, please check our [paper](https://www.mlasworkshop.com/_files/ugd/35b7d8_ff9e5682cbbe44338b3f1154541ae45f.pdf).
